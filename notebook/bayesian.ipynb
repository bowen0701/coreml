    "## Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Thomas Bayes and Pierre-Simon Laplace were aware of what is now known as **Bayes theorem,** or the so-called **inverse probablity,** which is a simple and beautiful relation between two conditional probabilities; one is an inverse of the other. I will borrow [Michael Hochster (Director of Data Science at Stitch Fix)'s Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-Bayes-Rule/answer/Michael-Hochster) and provide another example to illustrate the concept of Bayes theorem.\n",

    "**Example (Rich and Happy).** Your friend is trying to convince you that money cannot buy happiness, citing from a Harvard study that shows only 10% of happy people are rich, thus we have $P(\\text{rich}\\ |\\ \\text{happy})$. Nevertheless, what we really want to know is how is the proprotion of rich people is happy, that is $P(\\text{happy}\\ |\\ \\text{rich})$. How could we obtain the result?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some probability calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{happy}\\ |\\ \\text{rich})\n",
    "= \\frac{P(\\text{happy}, \\text{rich})}{P(\\text{rich})}\n",
    "= \\frac{P(\\text{rich}\\ |\\ \\text{happy}) \\times P(\\text{happy})}{P(\\text{rich})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above equation we can observe that we have to know how is the proportion of happy people in the whole population, and how is the proportion of rich people. Suppose we know that 40% of people are happy, and 5% of people are rich, then the result follows. Specifically, summarizing the information we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10% of happy people are rich: $P(\\text{rich}\\ |\\ \\text{happy}) = 10\\%$\n",
    "- 40% of people are happy: $P(\\text{happy}) = 40\\%$\n",
    "- 5% of people are rich: $P(\\text{rich}) = 5\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, after simple calculation, we obtain that $P(\\text{happy}\\ |\\ \\text{rich}) = 80\\%$, that is, 80% of rich people are happy. So a really strong majority of rich people are happy. Let's work hard and smart to be rich. :-)"
